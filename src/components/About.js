With the development technologies in the areas of augmented reality and devices that we use in our daily life, these devices are becoming compact in the form of Bluetooth or wireless technologies. This paper proposes an AI virtual mouse system that makes use of the hand gestures and hand tip detection for performing mouse functions in the computer using computer vision. The main objective of the proposed system is to perform computer mouse cursor functions and scroll function using a web camera or a built-in camera in the computer instead of using a traditional mouse device. Hand gesture and hand tip detection by using computer vision is used as a HCI [1] with the computer. With the use of the AI virtual mouse system, we can track the fingertip of the hand gesture by using a built-in camera or web camera and perform the mouse cursor operations and scrolling function and also move the cursor with it.

While using a wireless or a Bluetooth mouse, some devices such as the mouse, the dongle to connect to the PC, and also, a battery to power the mouse to operate are used, but in this paper, the user uses his/her built-in camera or a webcam and uses his/her hand gestures to control the computer mouse operations. In the proposed system, the web camera captures and then processes the frames that have been captured and then recognizes the various hand gestures and hand tip gestures and then performs the particular mouse function.

Python programming language is used for developing the AI virtual mouse system, and also, OpenCV which is the library for computer vision is used in the AI virtual mouse system. In the proposed AI virtual mouse system, the model makes use of the MediaPipe package for the tracking of the hands and for tracking of the tip of the hands, and also, Pynput, Autopy, and PyAutoGUI packages were used for moving around the window screen of the computer for performing functions such as left click, right click, and scrolling functions. The results of the proposed model showed very high accuracy level, and the proposed model can work very well in real-world application with the use of a CPU without the use of a GPU.With the development technologies in the areas of augmented reality and devices that we use in our daily life, these devices are becoming compact in the form of Bluetooth or wireless technologies.
